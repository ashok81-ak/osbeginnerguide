Creating an Application on OpenShift
------------------------------------

Steps you have already done
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Signed up for https://openshift.redhat.com/app/account/new[an OpenShift account]
* Installed the https://www.openshift.com/get-started#cli[command line tools]. While we could have used the web interface or the eclipse tools - we believe the command line tools are the best getting started experience (when not assuming an IDE) for people who intend to develop applications on OpenShift. Please stop after you are done with step 2. 

I will explain the _rhc setup_ command below. 

Getting the command line tools set up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have installed the tools we need to get them configured to work with your account on OpenShift.
