Introduction
-----------

Welcome to the Impatient Absolute Beginners guide to OpenShift. 

Why do you care
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fundamentally, the reason you want to use OpenShift is because you like writing applications, not administering servers. With just a couple of changes in the way you do your application development, you can spin up your web server and database with one command. You will no longer need to keep the operating system up to date, patch the web servers, maintain the DNS, and all the other tasks that distract you from writing code. By the end of this guide you should be all set to understand how to build, deploy, and host your applications on OpenShift.

Who you are:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are a web or mobile application developer - you write apps that use HTTP for part or all of their communication with the end users of your application. If you are a systems adminstrator and you want to understand all the ways OpenShift makes you life better, please go to the http://HHHHH.COM[following documents????]

As the title indicates, we are assuming little in the way of background knowledge except:

* Know how to create a web application
* Know how to use the command line
* You can program in one of the six programming languages OpenShift supports
* You can use a text editor on a Linux machine, the most basic is http://www.nano-editor.org/docs.php[nano] but VI or Emacs will be okay as well

This guide is intended for programmers who want to get started using OpenShift as quickly as possible but also want to understand a little bit of what they are doing.  

Goal of this document:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We want to enable you to be self sufficient in the basic use of Openshift for creating and hosting your web applications in as little text as possible. Therefore, we will not go in to long explanations of technology used in OpenShift or different programming paradigms but instead give you links where you can go to read more.

Everyone is invited to help contribute and improve the document. Sole responbility about what goes in the original github site belongs to the OpenShift team for now. That said, we encourage debate and discussion on the flow and direction of the document.

The document is written in http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/index.html[AsciiDoc], a simpler format than DocBook but with all the ability to output to multiple formats. The best reference is the http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html[AsciiDoc User Guide], but there are some guides avaiable http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/#writing-in-asciidoc-first-steps[here], https://github.com/jakoch/asciidoc-cheatsheet[here], and http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/book-multi.html[here]. Given the ability of Github to render AsciiDoc, this format also seemed a natural choice for the tutorial.
